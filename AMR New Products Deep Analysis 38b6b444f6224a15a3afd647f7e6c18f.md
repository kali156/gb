## Introduction

Evaluation of  products related to combating antimicrobial resistance (AMR). To do this it could concentrate on such areas as the drug development pipelines, latest clinical trials, form of antibiotics, and major pathogens that these new therapies are directing towards. It also might consider the state of innovation of AMR related technologies and products, barriers to the development and launch of new products and solutions, as well as mechanisms of resistance to the new products and their differential distribution across the regions.




# AMR New Products Deep Analysis

<aside>
ðŸ’¡

Resource : from the WHO ( World Health Organization ) 

the Data of update : Nov-21

</aside>

The dataset is measure effect Different Drugs with different methods and measure different variables 

like : how drugs active against Priority Pathogen 

<aside>
ðŸ’¡

**Key insights :**

- **The dataset analyzes various drugs' effects on priority pathogens, focusing on antibiotics and non-traditional categories**
- **32 antibiotic products are included, with the majority in Phase I of R&D**
- **Non-traditional categories include bacteriophages, immunomodulating agents, microbe-modulating, miscellaneous, and antibodies**
- **Bacteriophages and phage-derived enzymes (9 products) show promise, with 5 out of 9 in Phase II**
- **Immunomodulating agents (2 products) demonstrate potential, particularly against priority pathogens**
- **Microbe-modulating products (9 in total) primarily target Clostridioides difficile**
- **Miscellaneous category (5 products) includes various antibacterial classes with diverse administration routes**
- **Antibodies (6 products) show promising effectiveness against all tested pathogens**

# Antibiotics:

the numbers of the antibiotics in the dataset is : **32 Product**

### **What is the antibacterial class of the antibiotics ?**

**there is +30 bacterial class for this antibiotics.**

### **the R.D phase of the Products :**

the vast majority of the Products is still in the Phase I

# **Non-Traditional Categories**

**the Non-Traditional Categories is divided into 5  :**

1. **Bacteriophages and phage-derived enzymes**
2. **Immunomodulating agents**
3. **microbe-modulating**
4. **Miscellaneous**
5. **antibodies data**

# Bacteriophages and phage-derived enzymes

the numbers of the **Bacteriophages and phage-derived enzymes type Drug** in the dataset is : 9 **Product**

### **What is the antibacterial class of the** Bacteriophages and phage-derived enzymes**?**

There is four Antibacterial class : 

![antibacterial calss.jpg](antibacterial_calss.jpg)

### **the R.D phases of The** Bacteriophages and phage-derived enzymes **Products :**

The 5 out of 9 of these product in the Phase II

### **the Route of Administration of the different Products**

### **Result**

![Result.png](Result.png)

# **Immunomodulating agents :**

there is only 2 **Immunomodulating agents products** 

### **What is the antibacterial class of the Immunomodulating agents ?**

there is two (anti bacterial classes in the data) : 

- AntagonistÂ ofÂ super-antigenÂ exotoxinsÂ andÂ CD28Â T-cell
- RecombinantÂ humanÂ plasmaÂ gelsolinÂ protein

### **the Route of Administration of the different Products ?**

### **What is the Names of the Pathogen that immuno-modulating agents tested on ?**

### Result :

![Activity.png](Activity.png)

<aside>
ðŸ’¡

so seems Like **Rhu-pGSN** product is very promising against Priority Pathogen  and may be **RecombinantÂ humanÂ plasmaÂ gelsolinÂ protein**

is very good 

</aside>

# **Microbe-Modulating**

the numbers of the **Microbe-Modulating type Drug** in the dataset is : 9 **Product**

### **What is the antibacterial class of the Microbe-Modulating Products ?**

- **LiveÂ biotherapeuticÂ product**
- **AntibioticÂ inactivatorÂ andÂ protectiveÂ colon-targetedÂ adsorbent**
- **AntibioticÂ inactivator**

![the most drugs has been developed by Live bio-therapeutic products.png](the_most_drugs_has_been_developed_by_Live_bio-therapeutic_products.png)

### **the Route of Administration of the different Microbe-Modulating Products ?**

![route of adminstration.png](route_of_adminstration.png)

### **What is the Names of the Pathogen that Microbe-Modulating Products tested on ?**

the only pathogen that Products tested on is : ***ClostridioidesÂ difficile***

Except SVT-1C469 has been Tested against Multiple Pathogens

### **Results**

![Results.png](Results.png)

![pathogens had been tried aganist pathogens.png](pathogens_had_been_tried_aganist_pathogens.png)

<aside>
ðŸ’¡

Because **The lack of Data** we could not know how Products  effect ***ClostridioidesÂ difficile.***

Except that data **SVT-1C469** Product show Promising Potential against **HelicobacterÂ pylori** Pathogens.

</aside>

# **Miscellaneous**

## Summary The Result

From our analysis and summarize the given data( [here](https://vigorous-dahlia-f5d.notion.site/AMR-New-Products-Deep-Analysis-38b6b444f6224a15a3afd647f7e6c18f) you can find this deep analysis )  
and after comparing between each product category and R.D.Phase.It turns out that the use of unconventional(Non-traditional) products is highly effective, up to 96%, and that taking medications intravenously is always effective.
